Automatic FusionInventory-Agent from Live USB
=============================================

Usage
=====

Before build
------------
In order for inventory data to be accurate with your server configuration, you
must redefine options in file
config/includes.chroot/etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg

Build
-----

Following commands will configure and then build (after some time, depending on
your network connection) an ISO file automatically configured to launch
fusioninventory-agent at boot:
 $ sudo apt install live-build
...
 $ sudo lb config
...
 $ sudo lb build
...

All build process is logged into build.log file.


This ISO file can be copied to USB key with dd, with a /dev/sbd USB:
 $ sudo dd if=live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso of=/dev/sdb
/!\ Take care /!\ This will delete *all* data on /dev/sdb disk !


Before inventory
----------------
Do not forget to desactivate rule based only on hostname on server.
